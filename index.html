        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in New Jersey. I can speak both English and Korean. I went to Syracuse University for film production, but left to pursue a career in web development.</p>

        <h1>Interview</h1>
        <h2>What made you pursue web development over film production?</h2>
        <p>I always liked watching ideas that I had in my head go from conception to execution. This was partially the reason why I was attracted to film production in the first place. Instead of videos though, I enjoyed a greater satisfaction building websites, as it allowed me to connect with users on a more intimate level than film has allowed me to achieve. There are so many ideas that I have in my head begging to be made and I wanted to fufill that drive by pursuing web development.</p>
        <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
        <p>I like to play video games, build things with lego, code, and even minecraft blocks. Watching movies while eating delicious popcorn is another, as long as I don't remind myself how unhealthy the popcorn is.</p>
        <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
        <p>Being a super kickass front end developer making super kickass things.</p>
        <h2>What is your ideal working environment like?</h2>
        <p>Having a large monitor to work with and my dog, Sam, on my lap. A glass of some refreshing sweet ice tea on the side is always a plus too.</p>
